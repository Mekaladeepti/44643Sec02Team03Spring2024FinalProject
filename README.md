Custom Views: We've introduced custom views, including a global picker, back button, and buttons with shadows, to add polish and functionality to our interface.
Designable View Class: We've implemented a designable view class to easily manage and customize the appearance of UI elements throughout the app.
Interactive Feedback: Users will now be greeted with a pleasant sound upon opening the app, adding an interactive touch to their experience.
